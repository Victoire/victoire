Allows to filter any list's results

To create a new filter you have to build a Filter class extending the abstract Victoire\FilterBundle\Filter\BaseFilter class 

```php
    <?php
    
        namespace AppBundle\Filter;
        
        use Victoire\FilterBundle\Filter\BaseFilter;
        
        class TagFilter extends BaseFilter {
            
            /* will be the entry point to generate the result query of a filter */
            public function buildQuery(){}
            
            /* BaseFilter is an extension of symfony AbstractType so you can generate a form as usual */
            public function buildForm(){}
            
            /* Mandatory since when a filter is apply the WidgetListingContentResolver will identify the good filter with this method */
            public function getName(){}
            
            /* Method used in the WidgetListingContentResolver to recover the selected entity */
            public function getFilters(){}
        }
```
        
And you have to declare it in your services

```yaml
        victoire_blog.tag_filters.form.type:
            class: AppBundle\Filter\TagFilter
            parent: victoire_filter_bundle.abstract_base_filter
            tags:
                - { name: form.type }
                - { name: victoire_core.filter } 
```         

If your list has been created in query mode you can use the FilterFormFieldQueryHandler service 
wich is accessible in the Base Filter to build your query.

```php
    /* he takes the WidgetFilter and the class name of the filtred entity and return an array of that entities */
    $this->filterQueryHandler->handle($options['widget'], Tag::class);
```
